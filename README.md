# AlexEmoji
A CSS framework that provides my cute Alex emojis anywhere.

**Credits:** All emojis are made by the artist [tofokyo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tofokyo).

## All emojis
They can all be found at my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AlexFlipnote), their names are `:Alex<Name>` for the static emojis and `:aAlex<name>:` for the animated emojis.
The CSS has all the emojis available, they are all made lowercase for user friendlyness.
You can also check the `./images` folder and just take the name, put it in lowercase and remove the .gif/.png at the end.

## Usage
Create any element (recommended: `<i></i>`) and put `emoji` as one of the classes, after that you do `EMOJINAME`.
Animated emojis start with `a` (Example: `alexapopcorn`) while the rest are just lowercase everything (Example: `alexpopcorn`).

### Example
```html
<h1>Hiii <i class="emoji alexwave"></i></h1>
```
